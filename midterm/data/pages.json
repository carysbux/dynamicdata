            "description": "Gardening is a low-risk, high-reward activity that brings both relaxation and satisfaction. It teaches patience and delayed gratification, offering a grounding contrast to the fast pace of daily life. My interest in gardening began as part of a healthy eating journey and was inspired by my motherâ€™s beautiful gardens. Growing food at home provides fresh, nutritious options, while flowers and herbs make meaningful, personal gifts. The process is self-rewarding, whether enjoyed alone for peace of mind or shared with others as a collaborative hobby."
